# Testing Policy

Before a new release is created, the following must be tested:
- Does it compile.
- Does it run in development.
- Does it run in the launcher.
- Does it run the first or second time the client is game is launched on any machine.
- Does it work in normal gameplay, with the new features enabled. This may mean releases take longer, but it is probably worth it.
- Do old features still work correctly.
- Does it play nicely with Watchdog (and other anticheats).
